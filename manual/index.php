<a name="gameplay">IV. <b><u>Gameplay</u></b></a>
<p>
In order to play Ancient Beast, besides meeting the minimum requirements, you'll also needed a <a href="http://www.freezingmoon.org/account" target="_blank"><b>FreezingMoon</b></a> account. After logging in with your account, you'll have to pick a server, choose a faction (sin) and name your hero.
Each game server only hosts a defined number of players that will play an unique game world for a limited period of time, depending on victory conditions.
</p>
<p>
Players will use their hero in order to explore the game world and collect resources or fight foes. Fights take place in a special combat screen, which has some similarities with a chess game: combatants start of on opposite sides and get to control other creatures besides their heroes (in case they have one), also, the combat is based on a square grid and each combatant takes turns to make a move.
A combat arena has about 12x10 square tiles.
</p>
<p>
Creatures and heroes that die in battle remain dead and usually leave a corpse or some remains behind, that can be used for their ressurection or for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
Resources can be used for crafting, trading, evolving creatures or building a settlement.
Settlements can act as respawn points for players, also they can help training or evolving creatures, assists with resurrection of creatures or even provide creatures and lots of other things.
