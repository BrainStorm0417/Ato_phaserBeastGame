This is the only game mode that will have a fair pay-to-win element, allowing players to purchase unit packs in order to acquire random units that can be collected or used to battle other players, providing each player with more materialization choices during duels.
Plasma is being replenished each match for free, but the battles (pvp only) are hardcore otherwise, meaning that your units die, resulting in card loses and fewer units, but at the same time you can capture enemy units from the players you defeat in order to increase your army and options. In case a player has under 7 different unit cards, he will be granted up to 10 different random cards per day in order to be able to keep playing and hopefully win himself some enemy cards. Free cards cannot be captured in order to avoid cheating.
//could be done for bitcoin as well, default value being 0 though; other values could be shown when the game is not played through the store launches, as it's against their ToS
