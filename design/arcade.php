totally free, doesn't require account, has 4 modifiers

<p>
<b>Normal</b><br>
Meant to be played 1vs1 or 2vs2, in combat mode only, having matches ranging from 30 minutes to about 2 hours. The overall emphasis is being equal to your opponents in order to have a fair fight.
The combat field is hexagon tile based, having 9 rows, the odd ones being composed of 15 hexagons, while the even ones being 16.
All players start with a Dark Priest, which allows materializing units. Unlike Chess, the first turn advantage flaw is basically inexistent, as you're not enforced to using the same units as your opponent(s), but in fact you can actually counter the units they summoned if you wish or know how, while trying to copycat them would have you at a dissadvantage, as duplicate units always act slower.
Dark Priests posses an unique resource called plasma, which can be used for both defense, by powering your plasma shield and avoiding harm and for offense, materializing units in order to defeat your foe(s); you can of course make units and use them defensively, as meat shields, since most ranged attacks only hit the first encountered unit.

<p>
<b>Common</b><br>
All the players (2 or 4) have a shared unit inventory they can choose from, so first come, first served, each unit being able to get materialized just once on the combat field, being unique, so no copy-cat tactics and it can be trickier to obtain your wanted unit combos or to counter your foe(s), but you can always anticipate and grab certain units before other players do, kinda like in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sinner</b><br>
In this game mode each player chooses a realm and all the units from that realm are instantly materialized, prioritized from low to high level, so unit count restriction can still apply.
</p>

<p>
<b>Trivia</b><br>
This mode requires the player to answer a question with 4 possible answers at the start of each unit turn. If he gets the wrong answer, the unit will be skipped. The difficulty and domain of the questions depend on the unit realm and level.
<!-- TODO: Must associate each realm with a domain in order to eventually figure out the questions -->
