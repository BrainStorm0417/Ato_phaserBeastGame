This game mode requires registering an account. You can play for free for the current month by invitation, obtaining up to 7 locations from different realms (so you can build from all 7 sins and have 7 different lords).
//battleships type of castle siege, as player attacking needs to know your realm and structure location (kinda like a puzzle map, as they won't be able to see your structures without spying or attacking)
or you can become lord by subscription (5$/month), gaining 7 locations of different realms, which you can offer to other players (while unused), getting credited, maintaining vision of it and allowing you to obtain info
//maybe have a shared option, allowing you to do anything you want? or be able to recruit units for yourself as a tax or be able to receive gifts from the tenant ( ~_~ brainstormish)
//you can only attack players within a score margin of you (near you in the ladder)
If you would accept invitation from another lord to a realm you already gave away, then you would basically transfer your tenant to him, gaining back the same type of realm location.
//lords will be credited in hall of fame near the tenants, encouraging players to pay and even give away locations instead of keeping them unused
- has limited duration (1 month), meanwhile you build castle, gain score by fighting, climb the ladder in order to hopefully enter the hall of fame and earn prizes

* TODO: clean-up
<p>
This mode has persistent sessions lasting one month each, having a limited time at the start of the month when players can sign up for it. There are a limited number of free slots and if those are all taken, then a paid subscription is required for that specific month. This is one of the methods that allows fans to support the game's mentenance and development, because we all want things to run smooth and look good, don't we? The plasma pool won't be replenished between battles, the same goes for units, which die for good. Players will need to gather the necessary resources in order to build their city, having structures that will generate new units and replenish the plasma pool in order to be able to defend themselves or take offensive actions against enemy players. If your Dark Priest gets killed during battle, you won't be able to play another match in this mode until he revives, but you can spend plasma points to instantly revive him. When entering a match, you'll be required to have a minimum number of non-duplicated units and at least a certain number of plasma points. The score of each match will be constantly accumulted in order to reflect your position in the expansion's ladder. The players with the highest score each month will be immortalized in the hall of fame and also receive awesome prizes. You can play this mode only online, optionally by teaming up with another buddy, who also requires an account or subscription. Your buddy can even play from the same device as you provided authorization is granted or he uses a mobile device as a controller.

//skill to be able to tweak the godlet perhaps, more focus on what you need
// talk about the city; rts / farm ville style, building slots; homm3/4
//adventure mode only skill: having square/triangle/circle bots, allowing being in multiple locations; basically drones that can collect resources or teleport the hero to that location in order to fight / interact with stuff or self-destruct in order to avoid a fight; fighting and being defeated will result the destruction of all 3 drones; Drone Master; Leadership (+1/2/3 controlled units during combat)
//city and structures
//dwellings: structures where units grow, at some point multiple choices (homm4 style); each dwellings generates a certain number of units, depending on it's status; buildings can be damaged to be disabled
destroyed buildings allow enemy (anyone?) to recruit those units, being of the main ways of expanding your army with units from other factions, besides trading or building more cities (if actually possible)
//aliances
//talk about the resources prior to cities: gold and plasma

<!--// TODO: eventually keep only the generic info here and link to the "factions and dwellings" page where the structures will be showcased -->
<!-- TODO: ticket vs free/invitation differences -->
<p>
<u>Main structure</u><br>
When you pick a realm, you'll have to claim it by building a main structure on it. This has huge hitpoints, up to 7 levels, increasing resource generation, unlocking structures and providing some abilities, one each level, either defensive or offensive (iron curtain, shroud, plasma shield, lightning strike/storm, meteor shower, blizzard storm, comet, fog, satellite scan, mirrage, drone strike, super repair, disintegration, change position, sell structure, sabbotage/disable structure, earthquake, nuke strike, catapult siege, swap location, infiltrate)
</p>

<p>
1-7 dwellings
special structures, could be gold mine (or some realm specific resource) and plasma generator
city layout: 3x3 grid; square (homm3) or diamond (isometric, homm4) to be decided; battleships style, coordinate system 1-7 (realm), 1-3 (x), 1-3 (y), meaning 63 combinations<br>
//sloth special structure (reshaper/reconfigurator): split higher level unit into 2 smaller ones or the other way
</p>
<br>
//resources: gold (common), plasma (mostly used for combat) and 7 types of crystals, specific to each realm<br>

<p>This could be a laboratory, having a femur bone fence surrounding it.</p>
<u>Wooden Ship</u> - Scavenger<br>
<p>An old vessel, perhaps it was built to travel over the sands, or these places was once covered with water, who knows... mysterious flying creatures like to use them as homes as they're good places to hoard various junk they find and the masts allow them to easily keep an eye on the nearby area.</p>
<u>Circus Tent</u> - Mr. Stitches<br>
<p>A very ragged tent made out of various mismatching textiles that were sawn together. Many enter not to be seen ever again.</p>
<u>Light House</u> - Vertigo<br>
<p>This structure was probably designed to lure ships into rocks and bait lost creatures into approaching, seeking shelter during those nasty flesh ripping sand storms.</p>
<u>Desert Oasis</u> - Scorpius<br>
<p>While everything is all sun and sand around, the oasis is sure to attract desperate creatures with it's small pond to fill their thirst, tasty looking vegetation to fill their hunger and palm tree making shadow to cool off even more after eating and drinking. Yet they might be not weary that it's all too good to be true.</p>

<p>A rectangular glass tank, having the whole bottom covered with sand, some castle ruins on top of that, along with a few plants and such, but lacking any water in it.</p>
<u>Braille Library</u> - Troglodyte<br>
<p>A rectangular structure made all out of huge books, entrance being done in the middle of the lenght, after you climb some stairs. The roof is made out of 3 huge opened books facing upside-down. This structure contains some strange books, probably written in binary code, that only the troglodytes can read by swipping their tongues over the pages.</p>

<p>One or more snow caves that cave the entrances blocked by huge snow boulders.</p>
<u>Spring Fountain</u> - Deep Beauty<br>
<p>An interesting shaped fountain that has water gushing out of it at a constant rate.</p>
<u>Chess Pond</u> - Nightmare<br>
<p>A frozen lake which has a chess board carved into it, having the black sqares as holes into the ice. Some ice made chess pieces are on the white tiles, like rooks and pawns etc., maybe not horses as they might make the impression that Impalers can be recruited from this dwelling.</p>
<u>Winter Maze</u> - Impaler<br>
<p>A maze kinda like in "The Shinning" movie, having the bushes almost white as they're covered with snow. This makes the link regarding Impaler's ivy like toungue and poisonous vine skill along with the natural vegetation, the bushes that forming the maze itself. Around corners there are pits of ice spikes, so make sure that you don't move too fast and get tricked right in by the slippery floor.</p>
<u>Water Park</u> - Adaptation<br>
<p>Here's where all the fun is at! A blue colored spiral water slide, leading right into a pool of water that has a lot of deadly jellyfish in it. What more can you want during your vacation?</p>
<u>Arctic Palace</u> - Ice Demon<br>
<p>A cool palace having a lot of ice spikes around and the main entrance being through the mouth of a demonic figure. This sure doesn't look like a very friendly place to visit.</p>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Wrath</b><br>
<br>
<u>Skull Pile</u><br>
<p>This is my kind of thing: a huge different monster bone skull for each level. Really nasty looking stuff for the average guy, but this is definitely a head-hunter's dream collection, no doubt about it.</p>
